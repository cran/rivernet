Change history of rivernet package
==================================


Changes version 1.2.2 (01.01.2021) -> version 1.2.3 (28.08.2023)
================================================================

PR: update of maintainer email address


Changes version 1.2.1 (03.02.2020) -> version 1.2.2 (01.01.2021)
================================================================

PR: performance improvement of analyze.rivernet


Changes version 1.2 (03.03.2019) -> version 1.2.1 (03.02.2020)
==============================================================

PR: minor corrections to man pages


Changes version 1.1 (11.05.2017) -> version 1.2 (03.03.2019)
============================================================

PR: new method splitreach.rivernet added

PR: factors in attrib.reach and in attrib.node converted to strings

PR: function upstreamconnectivity: path.reachable now contain also reaches that 
    violate the condition but are shorter than thresh.length

PR: function adjacentregions: functionality modified to only contain internal
    reaches that do not fulfil the criterion (but are below the threshold length)

PR: function upstreamconnectivity: additional output streamorder.reachable

PR: new function getregionconnections, that returns a list of upstream, downstream
    and connecting paths between regions.

PR: function analyze: modified to overwrite existing columns rather than 
    append new versions

PR: function analyze: option for choosing the catchment outlet reach(es) 
    added
    
PR: function analyze: option to keep stream orders added; this makes it 
    possible to keep stream orders in cases of incomplete stream networks
    (in particular if rivers of low order are missing)

PR: function prune: modified to accept reaches rather than coordinates
    and to pune upstream or dowstrem of the indicated reaches while
    keeping the indicated reaches in the pruned network
    
PR: function prune: analyze is now called with the option of not modifying
    the stream order to not derive wrong stream orders if upstream reaches
    are pruned


Changes version 1.0 (16.10.2014) -> version 1.1 (11.05.2017)
============================================================

PR: Merging of reach and node attributes in case of multiple files:
    "rbind" replaced by "merge".
    A description of the types of merging was added to the help file.

PR: Description of value of "analyze" corrected. 

PR: New member function "getnodeind"

PR: Error analysis improved in rivernet.read

PR: Sorting of reaches according to identifiers removed

PR: New member functions "rivernet.write" and "prune"

PR: Addition of additional criterion "crit.node" to function
    "adjacentreaches"

PR: Additional output for very large river networks (> 10000 reaches)
    and modified order of file reading and analysis (to get read 
    errors earlier)

PR: Option to write only selected sub-networks in rivernet.write added.

PR: Error message for non-availability of altitude information removed.
